# Auxiliary  feature  learning  for  small  dataset  regularization
Dimensionality reduction is often used as a preprocessing step in classification. There are some dimensionality reduction techniques which transform the high dimensional data to new lower dimensional data. The autoencoders are now a popular method that are used to reduce the dimensions of the input features. This work performs dimensionality reduction autoencoders in three different databases. The features resulted in the autoencoders were then used to train a Suport Vector Machine classifiers that linearly separates the instances of a class from other classes instances. Feature importance and validation is performed for each dataset reaching accuracies of: 
99\%, 98.3\% and 71.2\%, respectively. The conclusion further discusses the results and possible improvements.
